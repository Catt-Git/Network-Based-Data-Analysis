# Network-Based-Data-Analysis
Hi! If you are a QCB student, good luck with the exam! If you need any help, feel free to reach out. 
These are the files you will find in this repository:
1) NBDA Catalano code.rmd - this is the code used for the project
2) NBDA Catalano presentation.pptx - this is the power point presentation I used at the oral exam
3) NBDA Catalano poject.pdf - this is the "paper-like" report

You can use the files as a reference to check whether youâ€™ve completed everything that was requested, remember that in the presentation you will leave out some analysis and only put the most impactful.
The dataset I used is: GSE17913
